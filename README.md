# rothko
See how one color looks on top of another

## What's this for?
Before I knew about the Inspector feature of Firefox and Chrome, I wanted a way to see how one color looks on top of another.
I was also interested in learning JavaScript, and this was a nice first project.
(I'm sure the code is terrible.)

## Why "Rothko"?
Mark Rothko was an abstract expressionist who made many large paintings with one color on top of another one.

## TODO
I don't plan to work on this anytime soon, but maybe some initiate will pick it up.
* Allow for adding new regions
* Link regions that should share the same color
* Allow addition of lorem ipsum
* Save a layout for later; scroll through saved layouts
